# IS_699_Project

This is my project for IS 699 Capstone project.
This is a Task Management Application. The app allows you to manage projects and tasks visually using board. 
One board represents one project. A board contains one or more lists. 
Each list represents the category of tasks, such as Todo, Doing and Done. 
You can drag-n-drop to change the order of lists, the order of tasks inside 
the list, and also move task from one list to another as well- to manage 
the project as it moves through different stages.

## Build Setup
